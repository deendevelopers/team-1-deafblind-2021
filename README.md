# Spectro

A web-app developed for the Deen Developers DeafBlind UK Hackathon.

### What is Spectro?
Spectro is a web-app created for people with sensory loss (hearing, sight and dual loss) to form friendships with volunteers and other like minded individuals. The aim of the app is to address loneliness and lack of social opportunities by offering a way to connect like minded people via similar interests or requests for assistance. 

### Who are our users?
The two primary user groups are (1) people with sensory loss, anywhere on the spectrum. Whether this is sight, hearing or dual loss. (2) Volunteers - anyone who may have a particular skill, e.g. sign language - or who want to assist with every day tasks.
